## Forked Tower: Blood Overview

The Forked Tower: Blood is the first raid available in **The Occult Crescent**, introduced in **Dawntrail**. The raid features multiple bosses and small-scale encounters, requriring a large group of players with good coordination to complete. The raid is designed for up to **48** players, but parties may enter with as little as **24** players should they still meet the entry requirements.

Entry to **The Forked Tower: Blood** is located within **The Occult Crescent: South Horn** and will require completing several prerequisites before players can enter the raid.

Read on for more information about **Occult Crescent** or click below to jump to the Raid Guide.

<Action title='Raid Guide' target='_self' color='raid' href='#raid-the-forked-tower-blood' />

## Occult Crescent Overview

**Occult Crescent** allows players to progress their character's power in **several different ways**, each serving to help the player in all **Occult Crescent**-related Field Operations.

These upgrades are not strictly required to clear the raid but are generally recommended if you plan to spend a lot of time in **Occult Crescent**-related Field Operations.

### Phantom Jobs

**Phantom Jobs** allow players to temporarily take on the abilities and roles of various jobs. Each **Phantom Job** has its own set of abilties or traits, unlocked by earning **Phantom EXP** and levelling up through FATEs, Critical Encounters (CEs) and Chain bonuses.

Reaching the maximum level on a **Phantom Job** will earn you a stack of **Phantom Mastery**, a permament buff increasing your damage dealt and healing potency by **~2-2.5%** for each stack, as well as adding 1 level to your **Phantom Freelancer**.

There are currently **13 Phantom Jobs** available in The Occult Crescent, some are purchased with **Enlightenment Silver and Gold Pieces** while others are dropped from various CEs.

| **Default** <br /> (Starting jobs) | **Silver Pieces** <br /> (1000 per job) | **Gold Pieces** <br /> (1600 per job) | **CE Drop** <br /> (Listed below, not guaranteed) |

<Action title='Full Interactive Map' color='purple' href='https://lynn.pet/map/southhorn' />

Upon completing the one-time quest, you can trade **3 Arcanite**, purchased from **Ermina** for **500 uncapped Tomestones** each, to **Dodokkuli** for a Phantom Weapon Penumbrae. Both vendors are located within Phantom Village.

### Arcanaut Sets

Arcanaut Sets are obtainable gear that offer substantial increases in universal offence while in **Occult Crescent**-related Field Operations.

Each gear piece costs **4000 Enlightenment Silver Pieces** and provide the following bonuses:
- **+40** Main Stat (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Mind)
- **+1** Special Attribute

Special Attribute scales up damage from all **Phantom Job abilities** that have "**Scale with item level**" in their tooltip description.

You can upgrade the Arcanaut sets using various upgrade materials obtained around **South Horn**:
- **Aetherspun Silvers** can be purchased for **1200 Enlightenment Silver Pieces** each. **3** are required to augment a single gear piece to +1.
- **Aetherial Fixatives** can be purchased for **1600 Enlightenment Gold Pieces** each. **3** are required to augment a single gear piece to +1.
- **Aetherspun Gold** can be found in Treasure Coffers scattered around **South Horn**. **3** are required to augment a single gear piece to +2.
- **X-Fixatives** can be purchased for **10 Sanguinite** each. **6** are required to augment a single gear piece to +2.

Each augment will add another **+40** Main Stat and **+1** Special Attribute to a gear piece of your choice.

### Set Up

::: tip NOTE
The nature of **Phantom Jobs** may allow players to take on other roles to cover any missing bases of tanking, healing and damage.

<Action title='Detailed Phantom Job Info' color='black' href='https://lynn.pet/occult/phantomjob' />
:::

Certain mechanics within the raid require **at least 6 parties, each with 4 players** to resolve. Additionally, any avoidable damage taken or mechanics failed will resolve in a stack of **Thrice-come Ruin** ^[Thrice-come Ruin], if not painful damage and instant death.

At a baseline, each party should aim for:

- **x1** Tank ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank]
- **x1** Healer ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Healer]
- **x2** DPS ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS]

Each party will also have a **Letter** / **Number designation**, to help position for those mechanics. These are:
- Party **A**
- Party **B**
- Party **C**
- Party **1** / **D**
- Party **2** / **E**
- Party **3** / **F**

Additionally, the raid should have the following **Phantom Jobs** to successfully clear the raid:

Per Party (**A** / **B** / **C** / **1** / **2** / **3**):
- **x1** Knight ^[Phantom Knight]
- **x1** Bard ^[Phantom Bard]

Per Alliance (**ABC** / **123**): 
- **x1** Thief ^[Phantom Thief]
- **x1** Geomancer ^[Phantom Geomancer]
- **x1** Time Mage ^[Phantom Time Mage]

Per Raid (**ABC123**):
- **x1** Berserker ^[Phantom Berserker]
- **x1** Oracle ^[Phantom Oracle]
- **x1** Cannoneer ^[Phantom Cannoneer]

Players not assigned any of the above **Phantom Jobs** are recommended to choose the following:

- **One of the above Phantom Jobs** - To serve as a backup.
- **Chemist** ^[Phantom Chemist] - To have access to **Revive**, the only method of circumventing the restriction on resurrections within the raid (besides **Healer LB3**).
- **Samurai** ^[Phantom Samurai] - To increase the group's overall DPS through its **high-damage weaponskills**.
- **Ranger** ^[Phantom Ranger] - To pop any traps deemed **too dangerous** to tread around.

::: tip NOTE
**Chemists** ^[Phantom Chemist] should ensure they have a stock of **Occult Potions** and potentially **Occult Elixirs** to fully utilise their kit, purchasable from the **Expedition Supplier** for **Gil** and the **Expedition Antiquarian** for **Enlightenment Silver and Gold Pieces**, both located within the base camp of South Horn.

**Samurais** ^[Phantom Samurai] should ensure they have a stock of **Occult Coffers** to fully utilise their kit, purchasable from the **Expedition Supplier** for **Gil** and the **Expedition Antiquarian** for **Enlightenment Silver and Gold Pieces**, both located within the base camp of South Horn.

**Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] and **Rangers** ^[Phantom Ranger] should ensure they communicate **clearly** with the team when deciding to pop traps.
:::

Depending on your role, you may be assigned **certain Phantom Jobs**, meant to compliment your role to better perform your duty. These are:

| **Role** | **Phantom Job**

### Encounters

#### Boss 1 - Demon Tablet

**Demon Tablet** is the first boss of **The Forked Tower: Blood**. It features several simple mechanics, but with harsh punishments and a **hard enrage** at **6:40**.

**Demon Tablet** will begin the fight by using **Demonic Dark II**, a very heavy hitting raidwide. On top of your standard mitigation, certain **Phantom Jobs** can also use:
- **Cannoneer** ^[Phantom Cannoneer] - **Silver Cannon**.
- **Ranger** ^[Phantom Ranger] - **Occult Unicorn**.
- **Time Mage** ^[Phantom Time Mage] - **Mage Masher**.

Throughout the fight, **Demon Tablet** will combine its primary attacks with **1** of **2** late-telegraphed attacks. To understand which attack the boss will use, players can read the **suffix** of the castbar. These are:

- **[Attack] of Dangers Near** - PB-AoE. Players should be about half a platform's length away from the boss.
- **[Attack] of Expulsion Afar** - **Linear knockback** originating from the boss. Players should be close to the middle, but not directly under the boss.

After the raidwide, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Ray of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** twice, firing lasers down one side of the arena. While preparing this, the boss will raise into the air, allowing players to cross through to the safe side. Players should make sure to position for the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** as they position themselves.

**Demon Tablet** will then target the **3** highest emnity players for **Occult Chisel**, an AoE tankbuster. **Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] should break away from the raid to ensure no one else gets hit.

##### Demonograph

**Demon Tablet** will cast **Demonograph of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**, raising into the air and creating **3** tower AoEs on each side. At least **4** players must be within a tower to successfully soak the damage. If not, the tower will explode, dealing heavy raidwide damage and applying a stack of **Thrice-come Ruin** ^[Thrice-come Ruin] for every tower missed.

To resolve this, the raid will split into their individual parties and position themselves to soak the tower closest to their waymark, with the players in the **Letter Alliance** crossing through while the boss is raised into the air. Players should make sure to position for the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** as they position themselves.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss1groups.webp)

After the towers resolve, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Rotate Left/Right**, rotating its body 90° and knocking away any players caught within its axis of rotation. Looking towards the boss, players should move in the opposite direction of the castbar.

**Demon Tablet** will then cast **Rotate Left/Right** again. Players should follow the same logic as before, but also ensure they are on the backside of the boss before it rotates. Anyone in front of the Boss after its 2nd rotation will be hit by a repeated frontal cleave AoE.

##### Cometeor

**Demon Tablet** will begin casting **Cometeor of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**, raising into the air and targeting random players with markers. These markers are:

- **4 Stack markers**, that also send everyone hit along a shown direction. **2** will be pointing **North** and **2** will be pointing **South**.
- **8 Meteor markers**, which place a large telegraphed AoE at the player's location when the debuff resolves.

The boss will also place **1 Meteor marker** at the very edge of a side of the arena.

To resolve this, **Stack** players should move to the required side so that their arrow is pointing towards **Demon Tablet** and **Meteor** players should move to the side with the Meteor marker along the edge. Finally, all other **unmarked** players should move to the side without the Meteor marker along the edge. Players should make sure to position for the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** as they position themselves.

After the cast resolves, players should get ready to resolve their mechanic:
- **Stack** players on the **non-Meteor** side should be along the wall, to get sent along their platform.
- **Stack** players on the **Meteor** side should be close to the boss, to get sent over to the safe side.
- **Meteor** players should place their AoE at the wall, before joining the **Stack** players on their side.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss1meteors.webp)

After the AoEs resolve, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Rotate Left/Right** again twice. Players should follow the same logic as before.

**Demon Tablet** will then cast **Summon**, raising into the air, making the area around itself unsafe and at the end of the cast, summoning **2 Summoned Demons** and **1 Summoned Arch Demon** on each side. Each party can use the same designation as the [**Demonograph**](#demonograph) towers to find their add. Each **Summoned Arch Demon** also spawns with a **defense increasing buff**. **Time Mages** ^[Phantom Time Mage] will need to remove this buff with **Occult Dispel**.

##### Gravity

**Demon Tablet** will cast **Summon** again, this time summoning **2 Gargoyle Statues** on each side. Later on, these will be levitated and then dropped, creating a large AoE at the impact point and leaving **1** corner of each side safe.

**Demon Tablet** will also cast **Demonography** again, this time creating **6** towers on one side of the arena. **3** of these towers will be levitated up.

Finally, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Gravity of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**, levitating the statues and any players standing beside them. Players can use the same **Colour** designation as their [**Demonograph**](#demonograph) towers to find which tower they will soak. However, since all the towers are on one side, all players **crossing over** should also stand next to the statues to levitate up. Players should make sure to position for the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** as they position themselves.

After the statues and all nearby players have been levitated, everyone should stand in their tower. And then finally stand at the safe corner left by the dropping **Gargoyle Statues**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss1gravity.webp)

**Demon Tablet** will then use the following sequence of attacks, before casting a **hard enrage** at **6:40**:

1. **Rotate Left/Right**
2. **Rotate Left/Right**
3. **Cometeor of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**
4. **Ray of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**
5. **Occult Chisel**
6. **Demonic Dark II**

#### Hallways

While trash mobs generally aren't very threatening, there are a few sprinkled throughout **The Forked Tower: Blood** with **dangerous casts** that we generally want to **avoid** or **interrupt**.

In general, you shouldn't pull any mobs unless you are a **Knight Tank** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] ^[Phantom Knight].

Additionally, almost all trash mobs can be **Slowed** by **Time Mages** ^[Phantom Time Mage] and instantly killed by **Samurai ^[Phantom Samurai], Cannoneer ^[Phantom Cannoneer] and Oracle ^[Phantom Oracle]**. Be sure to use your **Phantom Actions** here!

Below is a table noting some mobs and their **dangerous casts**, a table detailing which mobs are susceptible to which statuses and a detailed map of the hallways themselves, including traps and hidden rooms only discoverable though the **Thief** ^[Phantom Thief] action **Trap Detection**.

| **Enemy** | **Attack** |
| :-: | :-: |
| **Tower Manticore** | **Left/Right Hammer** - Late-telegraphed cleave AoE depending on the castbar, will hit the opposite side shortly after. |
| **Tower Scarab** | **Rhino Guard** - Grants itself an evasion buff. Use **Occult Dispel**. |

![](/images/fieldops/ft-hallwaysmobs.webp)

![](/images/fieldops/ft-hallwaysmap.webp)

::: tip NOTE
**Tanks** and **Rangers** should ensure they communicate **clearly** with the team when deciding to pop traps.

**Geomancers** should be ready to use **Suspend** in order to navigate the lightning floors.
:::

#### Boss 2 - Dead Stars

**The Dead Stars** can be considered the first wall of the raid, with mechanics that can easily wipe the party from **1** player's mistakes. It has a **hard enrage** at **7:00**.

To start, all players should **group** the trio of bosses in the middle. To deal as much cleave damage as possible before they split up for the rest of the fight.

When they do split up, each boss will cast **Decisive Battle**, a PB-AoE that also tethers the surrounding players hit to itself, ensuring they can't hit any other boss. To evenly split up the raid, each party will target the following:
- **A/1** - **Phobos** (Green) ^[Phobosic Gravity]
- **B/2** - **Triton** (Red) ^[Tritonic Gravity]
- **C/3** - **Nereid** (Blue) ^[Nereidic Gravity]

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2targets.webp)

Shortly after, each boss will also cast **Slice 'N' Dice** a conal tankbuster on the highest emnity target.

Each boss will then jump into the middle, casting **Three Body Problem**. Each time this happens, one of the **Dead Stars** will interrupt the cast, jumping into the middle, transforming the other two bosses and beginning a mini-phase.

After each mini-phase, the transformed bosses will jump to an edge of the arena, targeting the traitorous **Dead Star** with **Vengeful Fire/Blizzard/Bio III**, a wide conal AoE only leaving a safespot in between the **2** transformed **Dead Stars**. They will then **retether** to each player then return to their area, each casting **Delta Attack**, a repeated heavy raidwide, followed by **Fire Strikes**, a line stack AoE that also inflicts players with a **Magic Vulnerability** ^[Magic Vulnerability Up]. After [**Snowballs**](#snowballs), this is also combined with a **Slice 'N' Dice**.

##### Slimes

**Phobos** transformes the other **2 Dead Stars** into **untargetable** slimes.

**Phobos** begins with **Primordial Chaos**, a raidwide that inflicts every player with **1-3 stacks** of either **Nova Ooze** ^[Nova Ooze] or **Ice Ooze** ^[Ice Ooze] . Players will need to remove their debuff before the end of the mini-phase or they will immediately die.

Phobos will then begin casting **Frozen Fallout**, commanding the slimes to jump around the arena **4** times. To remove a stack of **Ooze** ^[Nova Ooze] ^[Ice Ooze], players must be hit by a jump of the opposite element. Once players have removed their stacks, they should instead look towards dodging **both** slimes. During the cast, players should sequentially keep track of which spots will be hit by a jump they want and which spots will be safe after removing their stacks.

After the **4** jumps, Phobos will cast **Noxious Nova**, a light raidwide that will **instantly kill** any players with any remaining **Ooze stacks** ^[Nova Ooze] ^[Ice Ooze]. This will also transform **Triton** and **Nereid** into their original selves.

##### Snowballs

**Nereid** transforms the other **2 Dead Stars** into **targetable** snowballs. Each snowball has **4 stacks** of **Icebound Buffoonery** ^[Icebound Buffoonery], an **invinciblilty buff** that must be removed to destroy the snowballs before their **hard enrage** at the end of the mini-phase.

**Nereid** begins with **Snowball Fight**, commanding the snowballs to charge **3 times** around the arena. Each charge is a **Wild Charge**, a line stack AoE that deals additional damage to the player closest to the enemy. Each charge also inflicts a **Physical Vulnerability** ^[Physical Vulnerability Up], preventing players from taking additional **Wild Charges** without **Invulnerabilities** ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] ^[Pledge]. At least **4 players** need to be in a single **Wild Charge** to remove a stack of **Icebound Buffoonery** ^[Icebound Buffoonery] from the snowball.

To resolve this, each party is designated to soak a certain **Wild Charge** from the snowballs:
- The **North** snowball's **Wild Charges** will be soaked by **A** -> **B** -> **C**, in that order.
- The **Southwest** snowball's **Wild Charges** will be soaked by **1** -> **2** -> **3**, in that order.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2snowballs1.webp)

After the **3** charges, **Nereid** will begin casting **Chilling Collision**, a knockback originating from itself, while the snowballs will tether to a random player and cast **Avalaunch**, a **targeted Stack AoE** that will also remove a stack of its **Icebound Buffoonery** ^[Icebound Buffoonery] should enough players share the damage. **Everyone** should stand on **Nereid's** hitbox, with **tethered** players standing on the opposite side of their tethered snowballs, and **non-tethered** players standing on the opposite side of the snowball they soaked previously. After the **knockback**, all players should stack at the wall.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2snowballs2.webp)

If done correctly, the snowballs will lose all stacks of their **Icebound Buffoonery** ^[Icebound Buffoonery], and players can destroy them before they finish casting their **hard enrage**.

##### Fireballs

**Triton** transformes the other **2 Dead Stars** into fireballs which jump away.

After the fireballs jump away, **2 sets of arrows** will appear in the arena, opposite of each other. They will travel a short distance counterclockwise before casting **Elemental Impact 3 times** and becoming targetable again. Eventually, they will cast a **hard enrage**, requiring players to destroy the fireballs before this happens.

To ensure even numbers for each fireball. The raid will split into **2**, with the **Letter Alliance** looking for arrows in the **Northern Half** of the arena, and the **Number Alliance** looking for arrows in the **Southern Half** of the arena.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2fireballs1.webp)

**Elemental Impact** is comprised of **2 major mechanics**:
- A tankbuster tower that must be soaked, inflicts a **Magical Vulnerability** each hit.
- **2 wide conal AoEs**, each targeting a **Healer** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Healer] and **DPS** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS] respectively, inflicts a **Magic Vulnerability** ^[Magic Vulnerability Up] each hit.

To resolve this, each Alliance should have **DPS** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS] standing along the wall, **Healers** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Healer] standing to the side of the fireballs, and a **Tank** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] soaking all **3 hits** with an **Invulnerability** ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] ^[Pledge], using the same soak order as the snowballs.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2fireballs2.webp)

After **Elemental Impact** casts **3 times**, the fireballs will target random players for a large baited AoEs while **Triton** besgins casting **Flame Thrower** a **Line Stack AoE** targeting a player on each side. To ensure all players are grouped up for the stack while minimising movement, all players will stack with the **DPS** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS] at the wall after the **3rd hit**, and travel around the fireball clockwise.

The cycle will repeat once again before the fireballs begin casting a **hard enrage**.

##### Enrage

After all **3 mini-phases** the **Dead Stars** will cast **Six-Handed Fistfight**, dealing raidwide damage, creating a lingering damage AoE in the middle and using the following cycle of mechanics **twice** before **hard enraging**:
1. **Collateral Damage** - **Telegraphed conal AoEs** targeting **3** slices of the arena, then the other **3**.
2. **Spread AoEs** - **Untelegraphed** spread AoEs, hitting several players at a time.

Each slice of the arena is assigned to a party, as shown in the image below.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2enrage.webp)

#### Bridges

Similar to **Hallways**, **Bridges** feature traps, lightning floors, and **dangerous adds** that must be handled in certain ways.

| **Enemy** | **Attack** |
| :-: | :-: |
| **Wave 1** & **4 - Tower Bhoot** | **Paralyze III** - Use **interrupt**. |
| **Wave 2 - Tower Abyss** | **Dense Darkness** - Grants itself an **Magic Damage Up buff**. Use **Occult Dispel**. <br> **Diffuse Darkness** - Heavy raidwide. |
| **Wave 3 - Tower Idol x6** | **Ancient Aero III** - **Enrage**. Wait for all **6** to begin casting, then Stop with **Romeo's Ballad**. |
| **Wave 5 - Tower Progenitor/Progenitrix** | **Close/Far Call to Detonate** - **Drag them Far/Close** from each other respectively, else repeated heavy raidwides. <br> **Bombshell Drop** - Spawns tethered **Lava Bombs** that move towards the enemy, heavy raidwide if they make contact. <br> **Targeted Stack AoE** - Stack. <br> **Massive Explosion** - **Enrage** cast that starts as soon as one dies. Keep them at **similar HP**. |

While dealing with these enemies, each side of the bridge will glow with **4 line AoEs**. These are **Wild Charges** that inflict the **1st player hit** with a **piercing vulnerability**, all players must stack under **1 line**, with **Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] at the front.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-bridgesmap.webp)

#### Boss 3 - Marble Dragon

**Marble Dragon** focuses primarily on dodging, but can still very easily punish players that are slow on movement. It has a **hard enrage** at **6:30**.

**Marble Dragon** begins with **Imitation Star**, a heavy raidwide that inflicts a **bleed** ^[Bleeding].

**Marble Dragon** then faces towards a random player and begins casting **Draconiform Motion**, an untelegraphed front and back conal cleave. Players must move to its sides to dodge the attack. The boss will combine this attack with future mechanics to punish early movers. To resolve each instance of this, players should always stack **North** and **South** if they aren't required to move.

**Imitation Rain** is a light raidwide that creates multiple puddles within the arena. Each puddle has **3** variations:
- **Flat** - Will detonate in a large **PB-AoE** shortly after freezing, freezing other nearby puddles.
- **Spiked** - Will detonate in a **plus AoE** shortly after freezing, freezing other nearby puddles.
- **Tower** - Will detonate in a **stack AoE** when frozen. At least **4 players** must be in the tower or it will detonate for a heavy **bleed**.

For this first pattern, they will appear with **Flat** and **Spiked** puddles in a horizontal line **North** and **South**.

**Imitation Icicle** will create **2 "white" AoEs** on the floor, when they detonate, they will freeze the nearby puddles. Players must first bait a **Draconiform Motion**, before moving to the wall with the **"white" AoE** closer to it. Once players are at the wall, they can dodge the exploding puddles safely, by crossing from one side of the waymark to the other.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss3puddles.webp)

Afterwards, the boss will target the **6 highest emnity targets** for **Dread Deluge**, a heavy tankbuster that also inflicts a **bleed** ^[Dropsy].

##### Frigid Twister

**Marble Dragon** will use **Imitation Rain** again, creating more puddles in a hexagon pattern, and cast **Frigid Twister**, spawning **2 Frigid Twisters** on the **East** and West** of the arena. These **Frigid Twisters** will travel around the arena either **clockwise** or **counter-clockwise**, freezing any puddles it comes across.

Finally, **Marble Dragon** will jump to the middle and begin casting **Draconiform Motion**.

There are **2** potential patterns, depending on which puddles the **Frigid Twisters** freeze first. Dodge the **Draconiform Motion**, then:

- **Spiked First**
	1. Stay under the Boss's hitbox or move to a waymark at the wall.
	2. Move to the corner where the **Spiked Puddles** detonated.

- **Flat First**
	1. Move to the **Spiked Puddles** in the corner.
	2. Move to the waymark at the wall when the middle **Spiked Puddle** detonates.

Afterwards, **Marble Dragon** will follow up with another **Dread Deluge**.

##### Adds

**Marble Dragon** will jump back to the middle and begin casting **Withering Eternity**, leaving the arena when the cast finishes and summoning **6 Ice Golems**. These **Ice Golems** gain a **Vulnerability Down buff** ^[Vulnerability Down] when in close proximity of each other, and will cast **Frozen Heart** if not defeated in time, granting themselves a **Physical Damage Up buff** ^[Physical Damage Up] that will instantlly kill anyone they attack. **1 tank** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] from each party should grab an **Ice Golem** and drag it towards their party's closest wall, using their **Invulnerability** ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] ^[Pledge] if the **Ice Golems** cast **Frozen Heart**.

Additionally, **Marble Dragon** will use the following cycle of attacks **twice** before returning:
1. **Imitation Rain** - Spawning **1 Spiked Puddle** in the middle and **3 Tower Puddles** along the wall, opposite each other.
2. **Frigid Dive** - The boss will dive through the middle of the arena, freezing the **Spiked Puddle** and **2 Tower Puddles**.
3. **2 Tower & Spiked Puddles** - The **2 Tower & Spiked Puddle** will detonate, freezing the other **4 Tower Puddles**.
4. **4 Tower Puddles** - The remaining **4 Tower Puddles** will detonate.

Upon returning, **Marble Dragon** will summon **6 Tethered Ice Sprites**, rendering itself **invincible** ^[Invincibility] as the **Ice Sprites** travel towards the boss and cast **Withering Eternity**, an incredibly heavy raidwaide. Players must defeat the **Ice Sprites** before they reach **Marble Dragon**, they are susceptible to **Stop** from **Bard's ^[Phantom Bard] Romeo's Ballad** and **Oracle's ^[Phantom Oracle] Cleansing**.

To resolve the entirety of the **Adds** phase, parties will resolve their **Ice Golems**, **Towers** and **Ice Sprites** within their designated area along the wall. **Parties A**, **C**, **1** and **3** should be mindful that any **Tower Puddles** at their **East** and **West** becomes their priority to fill.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss3adds.webp)

After **Withering Eternity**, **Marble Dragon** will repeat the **Imitation Rain** sequence shown at the start of the fight, only this time marking some players with **Throttle** ^[Throttle], a **debuff** that will instantly kill them if not cleansed, and **Wicked Water** ^[Wicked Water], a **debuff** that traps them within a **Gelid Gaol** when hit by a detonating **puddle**. Players can cleanse the **Throttle** ^[Throttle] by being hit and frozen by a detonating **puddle**, and then being broken out by other players destroying the **Gelid Gaols** imprisoning them.

**Marble Dragon** will then cast **Imitation Star** again.

##### Frigid Twister 2

Similar to [**Frigid Twister**](#frigid-twister), **Marble Dragon** will use **Imitation Rain**, this time spawning **2 Flat Puddles** on **2 opposite cardinals**, **2 Spiked Puddles** on the other **2 opposite cardinals** and finally **6 Tower Puddles** in either a horizontal or vertical rectangle in the middle. The boss will also cast **Frigid Twister**, then jump to the middle again and begin casting **Draconiform Motion**.

To resolve the **Tower Puddles**, **Parties A**, **C**, **1** and **3** have fixed positions, and will always soak the corner towers. **Parties B** and **2** will flex, soaking any **North/East** towers and **South/West** towers **respectively**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss3towers.webp)

Players will need to dodge the **1st** set of detonating **puddles**, then soak their towers, then dodge the **2nd** set of detonating **puddles**.

The cycle of **Draconiform Motion** -> **Detonate** -> **Tower** -> **Detonate** will repeat again. After dodging the **2nd** set, be sure to remain where you dodged until **Marble Dragon** begins casting **Draconiform Motion** again.

**Marble Dragon** will finally cast **Imitation Star** and **Dread Deluge**, before entering it's **hard enrage** cast at **6:30**.

#### Lockwards

Similar to Hallways and Bridges, Lockwards combines traps and somewhat deadly trash with a small puzzle segment players can choose to solve correctly or skip. **Time Mages** ^[Phantom Time Mage] should remember to slow any enemies here.

| **Enemy** | **Attack** |
| :-: | :-: |
| **Guardian Wraith** | **Scream** - Huge untelegraphed PB-AoE, inflicts anyone hit with **Terror** ^[Terror]. |
| **Guardian Berserker** | **Vulnerability Down** ^[Vulnerability Down] - Can only be defeated through **instakill** actions. **Oracle's ^[Phantom Oracle] Phantom Doom**, **Samurai's ^[Phantom Samurai] Iainuki** and **Cannonner's ^[Phantom Cannoneer] Phantom Fire** all work. |
| **Guardian Golem** | Inflicts **Toxic Minerals** ^[Toxic Minerals] to nearby players, becoming a **cleansable Doom** ^[Doom] when the debuff expires. |
| **Guardian Knight** | **Invincibility** ^[Invincibility] - Can be dispelled by **Time Mage's ^[Phantom Time Mage] Occult Dispel**. Refreshes occasionally. <br> **Buster Knuckles** - **Telegraphed PB-AoE** followed by a **late-telegraphed Donut AoE**. <br> **Line of Fire** - **Untelegraphed Line AoE** in the direction it's facing. |
| **Guardian Weapon** | **Armed to the Teeth** ^[Armed to the Teeth] - Massive damage buff, must be removed by **Thief's ^[Phantom Thief] Pilfer Weapon**. |
| **Master Lockward** | **Untelegraphed Raidwide** - Uses at low health. Use mitigation. |

The general order of interrupts for the **Lockwards** themselves is:
1. **A**/**B**/**C** **MTs**
2. **A**/**B**/**C** **OTs/D3s**
3. **1**/**2**/**3** **MTs**
4. **1**/**2**/**3** **OTs/D3s**

If choosing to do the puzzle correctly, a **Sanguine Recluse** will spawn somewhere in South Horn, the location divulged only to players within the tower. The **Sanguine Recluse** cycles through the following attacks:
1. **Tartarean Flame** - A telegraphed **Donut AoE**.
2. **Tartarean Thunder** - A telegraphed **Large PB-AoE**.
3. **Cryptcall** - A fast telegraphed frontal cone AoE, inflicts a **cleansable Doom** ^[Doom] to anyone hit.

Defeating the **Sangune Recluse** will provide all players that participated in killing it **2 Sanguinite**. Players inside the raid will recieve an additional **5 Sanguinite** after **Magitaur**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-lockwardsmap.webp)

#### Boss 4 - Magitaur

**Magitaur** is the final boss of **The Forked Tower: Blood**. It features several mechanics that can quickly wipe the raid, and a hard enrage at **8:00**.

**Magitaur** will begin the fight with **Unsealed Aura**, a raidwide. While casting this, players should move to their designated square where they will be resolving most mechanics, shown below.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4squares.webp)

The boss will then use **Unseal** ^[Unsealed], creating a glow around one of its held weapons and augmenting its auto attacks until a future mechanic. **All players** should keep an eye on which weapon is glowing:

- **Axe (Yellow)** - Tankbuster auto attacks on the 2 closest targets in each square. **Yellow Canisters** will augment its next **Aura Burst**.
- **Lance (Blue)** - Tankbuster auto attacks on the 2 furthest targets in each sqaure. **Blue Canisters** will augment its next **Aura Burst**.

**Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] should move close or far accordingly to bait the auto attacks. Everyone else should remain on the boss's hitbox.

##### Assassin's Dagger

**Magitaur** will begin casting **Assassin's Dagger**, sending out **3 telegraphed line AoEs** that hit the same location twice before rotating. While this mechanic has no "correct" resolve besides dodging the attacks, most raid groups will use **BAP Waymarks**, waymarks specially designed to **minimise the movement** required for this mechanic. Players can simply stand on an appropriate waymark "next to the AoE" while the daggers rotate, until the **following attack** requires them to move:

| **Critical Axeblow** | **Critical Lanceblow** |
| :-: | :-: |
| A **large untelegraphed PB-AoE**, hitting **near the boss** as well as any area that **isn't a square**. <br> The safe spot is at the **far corner of a square**. | An **untelegraphed Donut AoE**, hitting **around the boss** as well as any area that **is a square**. <br> The safe spot is **close to the boss, in between the squares**.
| ![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4axeblow.webp) | ![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4lanceblow.webp) |

Players will need to **read the castbar** and navigate to the correct spot, while staying mindful of the daggers still rotating around the arena. The daggers will stop rotating when the **2nd** cast of **Critical Axeblow/Lanceblow** finishes.

**Magitaur** will then cast **Forked Fury**, a tankbuster targeting the closest and furthest player in each square. **Letter Alliance Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] will bait the close hit, while **Number Alliance Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] will bait the far hit.

After **Forked Fury**, **Magitaur** will then use **2 more auto attacks**, **Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] should position to soak these again.

**Magitaur** will then begin casting **Aura Burst**, a heavy raidwide that becomes augmented by the surrounding canisters of the same colour. Depending on which weapon was augmented, players will want to destroy **Axe Empowerment Conduits (Yellow)**, if the **Axe** was augmented or **Lance Empowerment Conduits (Blue)** if the **Lance** was augmented. When these **Conduits** are destroyed, they will target the **2 closest players** for unbelievably high damage. **Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] should stand under the **Conduits** ready to press an **Invulnerability** ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] ^[Pledge] before the **Conduits** are destroyed.

Additionally, **1 Universal Empowerment Conduit (Purple)** will appear. When this **Conduit** is destroyed, it will fire a line AoE at the **closest target**, inflicting anyone hit with **Hysteria** ^[Hysteria], forcing them in random directions until the debuff falls off or they die. A **Berserker** ^[Phantom Berserker] will need to place themselves between the **Conduit** and the wall and use **Rage**, destroying the **Conduit** and negating the **Hysteria** ^[Hysteria] debuff.

If all relevant **Conduits** are destroyed, **Aura Burst** will only deal heavy raidwide damage and **will not** wipe the raid.

##### Sage's Staff

**Magitaur** will cast **Sage's Staff**, spawning **3 Staffs** in the arena. These **Staffs** will target the **closest player** for a **line stack AoE**. Before the **Staffs** resolve, the boss will use **Critical Axeblow/Lanceblow**. Players must dodge the **Axeblow/Lanceblow**, then huddle up in the very middle of the arena to share the damage. **Magitaur** uses this cycle of attacks **once again** before ending with an **Unsealed Aura** and moving on to the next mechanic.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4sagestaff.webp)

##### Rune Axe

**Magitaur** will begin this set of mechanics by first casting **Unseal**. This **Unseal** ^[Unsealed] is guaranteed to augment the **Axe**, so **Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] should prepare by standing close to the boss in their sqaure. **Magitaur** will then auto attack **3 times** before casting **Rune Axe**. Players should **stay in their home square** until the cast finishes.

**Rune Axe** will randomly inflict a certain amoumt of players in **each square** with the following debuffs:

| **Party** | **10s** | **13s** | **21s** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **A**/**1** | **Prey: Greater Axebit** ^[Prey: Greater Axebit] | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] | **Prey: Greater Axebit** ^[Prey: Greater Axebit] |
| **B**/**2** |  | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] |
| **C**/**3** |  | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] |

When any of these debuffs expire, a **targeted AoE** around the player will detonate, also inflicting damage to any **Square/Non-Square Flooring** the **AoE** touched. To resolve these sequences of debuffs expiring. We do the following for each set of debuffs:

- **Prey: Greater Axebit** ^[Prey: Greater Axebit] players should stand at the **very wall of the arena**, next to a **Purple Conduit**, ensureing they don't overlap their **AoE** with any **Square Flooring**.
- **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] players should stand in the **very middle of their square**, ensuring they don't overlap their **AoE** with the **Non-Square Flooring**.

Before the **13s** set of **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] resolve, **Magitaur** will cast **Critical Lanceblow**. **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] players should ensure they **let their debuff expire FIRST**, before moving into the safe zone.

During the **21s** set of debuffs, the **Northwest A/1 Square** will be safe for unmarked players to dodge into.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4runeaxe.webp)

After all debuffs have resolved, **all players** should return to their square. **Magitaur** will cast **Forked Fury**, followed by **2 Augmented auto attacks** and finally **Unsealed Aura** again. Players must destroy the **Yellow** and **Purple** conduits to prevent a raid wipe.

**Magitaur** will then use the [**Assassin's Dagger**](#assassin-s-dagger) sequence again, with no changes to how the mechanic is solved.

##### Holy Lance

**Magitaur** will begin this set of mechanics by first casting **Unseal**. This **Unseal** ^[Unsealed] is guaranteed to augment the **Lance**, so **Tanks** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] should prepare by standing far from the boss in their sqaure. **Magitaur** will then auto attack **3 times** before casting **Holy Lance**. Players should **stay in their home square** until the cast finishes.

**Holy Lance** will randomly inflict **3 players in each sqaure** with **Prey: Lancepoint** ^[Prey: Lancepoint]. When **Prey: Lancepoint** ^[Prey: Lancepoint] expires, a **Targeted Stack Aoe** around the player will detonate, also inflicting damage to any **Square/Non-Square Flooring** the **AoE** touched.

Additionally, **12 Lances** will fall into the arena, starting North on the **Non-Square Flooring** and rotating clockwise. These **Lances** will detonate in the same order they dropped, inflicting a **Thrice-Come Ruin** ^[Thrice-come Ruin] to any players standing in the same tile when it detonates.

As the **Lances** drop, **Magitaur** will cast **Critical Lancebow**.

To resolve these sequences of debuffs expiring, as well as avoiding each **Lance's** detonation, **Prey: Lancepoint** ^[Prey: Lancepoint] players will plant directly in the middle of their square, while any players' square that is currently being detonated by **Lances** will instead use the **Non-Square Flooring** to resolve their stack. The following sequence should look like:

1. **Lance 1 Detonates** - **A**/**1**/**B**/**2** players move to the middle of their **Square**, **C**/**3** cross over to the **Non-Square Flooring** using the far edges of their **Square**.
2. **Lance 4 Detonates** - **C**/**3** cross back into their square.
3. **Lance 5 Detonates** - **A**/**1**/**C**/**3** players move to the middle of their **Square**, **B**/**2** cross over to the **Non-Square Flooring** using the far edges of their **Square**.
4. **Lance 8 Detonates** - **B**/**2** cross back into their square.
5. **Lance 9 Detonates** - **B**/**2**/**C**/**3** players move to the middle of their **Square**, **A**/**1** cross over to the **Non-Square Flooring** using the far edges of their **Square**.
6. **Lance 12 Detonates** - **All players** move to the far corner of their squares to avoid **Critical Axeblow**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4holylance.webp)

After **Critical Axeblow**, **all players** should return to their square. **Magitaur** will cast **Forked Fury**, followed by **2 Augmented auto attacks** and finally **Unsealed Aura** again. Players must destroy the **Blue** and **Purple** conduits to prevent a raid wipe.

Finally, **Magitaur** will use one more [**Assassin's Dagger**](#assassin-s-dagger) sequence, with no changes, before casting a **hard enrage** at **8:00**.

Defeating **Magitaur** completes **The Forked Tower: Blood**. Congratulations!

First-timers can climb the stairs beyond the boss to find **Entry #30** in the **Occult Record**, as well as claim their **Demon Haul** mount from the **Achievements** window.
