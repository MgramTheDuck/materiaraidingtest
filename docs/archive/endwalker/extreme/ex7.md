### Notes
For Sparking/Branding, the following is a helpful way to remember what the follow up mechanic is (after resolving towers):\
`[S]`parking -> `[S]`pread\
`[B]`randing -> `[B]`uddies

## Waymarks
Markers are used to mark *some* of the safe spots during Visceral Whirl (excluding corners).

Variants of these markers exist where there are markers in the corners, or with a marker in the center

The `2` and `B` markers are also used by the marked player when dropping Black Hole
