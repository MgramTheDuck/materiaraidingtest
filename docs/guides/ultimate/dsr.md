## Fight Writeup (W.I.P)

Guide written by Juno (P1-5) and Noz (P6-7)

As a starter, a lot of the mechanics in this fight will cause **Damage Down** if solved incorrectly. This debuff reduces your damage by about 50% and it is common practice to wall **IF IT IS SAFE TO DO SO**, as the damage loss from resurrection weakness is less than damage down.

### Phase 1: Knights

This phase begins with two targetable bosses: Adelphel and Grinnaux.
Once pulled, tanks will stack the bosses and the party will stay south.

::: damage
As Adelphel goes untargetable soon after the phase starts, players should spend their buffs and openers on him. Throughout the phase both bossess should be kept as similar health as possible.
:::

After a **Holiest of Holy** raid wide Grinnaux will cast **Empty Dimension**, forming a donut AOE centered on him. At the same time Adelphel will cast **Holy Shield Bash**, a tethered AOE tankbuster that is targeted on a random player. The MT must walk through this tether and bring it north of the bosses to take the tankbuster **with invulnerability**. At the same time the party will take a **Heavensblaze** stack at the south.

After this stack and tankbuster combo, Adelphel will become untargetable and Grinnaux will cast:

#### Hyperdimensional Slash

Grinnaux will then target 4 random players with a line AOE. This AOE will drop a purple portal on the edge of the arena wherever it was aimed, and if two portals are too close to one another they will tether to eachother and wipe the raid. Similarly, if a player stands too close to a portal they will become tethered and die.

These 4 players must spread to the north of Grinnaux at max melee, where they will take a line AOE. The positions each player will take are designated by waymarks.

At the same time as the prey markers move north, the remaining party members will stack south of Grinnaux and take a large conal AOE stack that gets baited on a random non-prey player.

![](/images/ultimate/dsr-hyperslash.webp)

_Image taken from Tessan Twintails DSR video guide_

This process repeats twice, where the 2nd set of prey markers will instead spread south and the initial prey players will stack north.


Adelphel will then drop down onto a random cardinal and cast another **Holiest of Holy** and Grinnaux will cast **Faith Unmoving** which will knock players away from Grinnaux (who is still in the center of the arena). Players will use anti-knockback and position themselves so Grinnaux is between them and Adelphel, as Adelphel will then begin to dash across the arena in an hourglass shape.

Adelphel will start this dodge by either moving left or right, and the party will move the same direction and stand on the tip of an arrow shaped pattern in the arena . **(I'll try get a video for this - Juno)**

After completing his dashes, Adelphel will drop onto the player who had the highest emnity on him before he dissappeared, delivering a heavy hitting AOE tank buster that the OT will invuln. To avoid hitting the party with this, the OT will follow the party to the safe spot and then **continue moving past the party**. 

Adelphel will then immediately begin casting 1 of 3 instances of **Holiest Hallowing**, an interruptible heal targeted on Grinnaux. The OT will interrupt this and both tanks will position their bosses in the center of the arena for:

#### Playstation Chains

Each player will be marked with either a cross, square, circle, or triangle, so that there is two of each symbol. 

::: info NOTE
**Healers** can only ever get Cross or Triangle, **Tanks** can only get Cross or Square, and **DPS** can only get Square, Circle or Triangle
:::

The party will form around Grinnaux in the pattern seen below, and be knocked back by another **Faith Unmoving** to break their tethers. If unbroken, the resulting AOE will kill any players who have not resolved their tethers.

![](/images/ultimate/dsr-playstation.webp)

::: warning
A warning to warrior players; Inner release is perfectly timed in this phase to be up as this mechanic is resolving. This means that you'll be immune to knockback and therefore unable to resolve your tether. You can either prepull inner release earlier in the fight, or simply click the **Inner Strength** buff off during this mechanic.
:::

Immediately after this is resolved, the 2nd **Holiest Hallowing** cast will begin, and the ranged player (or main tank) will interrupt the cast. Both bosses should be stacked middle again for another **Holiest Holy** and either an **Empty** or **Full Dimension**. If it is **Empty** Grinnaux will do a donut AOE around him like before. If it is **Full**, move away from Grinnaux as he will cast a large circular AOE centered on him.

The final **Holiest Hallowing** will be interrupted by the OT again. At this point, if one of them dies before the other, they will begin to cast their enrage: either **Bull's Steel** or **Brightblade's Steel**. As such both bosses must be killed at roughly the same time.

After dropping their health to 0%, they will immediately become untargetable. Grinnaux will then **holmgang** the entire party to the western side of the arena, chaining them in a small circle. Attempting to leave this circle will kill the player immediately.

A new boss **Charibert** will then appear at the southern side of the circle and begin to cast **Pure of Heart**, the enrage of phase 1.

#### Pure of Heart

**Haurchefant** will run to the side of the circle and block an arrow. This arrow pulses intermittently, dealing damage to the party. 

Charibert will then cleave the two players closest to him, applying a 5s debuff **Skyblind**. Once this debuff wears off, an invisible AOE will drop under the players feet that will explode after a few seconds. To resolve this, we have players bait in the order **H → M → R → T**, where the ranged players will drop their AOEs on the east and the melee players will drop them on the west.

Once Charibert is reduced to approximately ~25-30% health, the DPS check is reached and as long as one player survives the transition the party will receive a checkpoint.

### Phase 2: Thordan

Phase 2 will begin with the MT facing Thordan north for 2 auto-attacks before he will begin casting **Ascalon's Mercy**, a baited protean on every member of the party.
The party will stack up behind Thordan before dodging to the side to avoid the cleave. 

::: info NOTE
The tell to move for this attack can either be the end of the castbar, or when Thordan raises his sword slightly.
:::

Thordan will then slash 3 times at the Main Tank with a tank buster **Ascalon's Might**.

::: tank
Due to the mit plan that MUR PF uses, if the MT is a **WAR** they can use their invincibility here for free.
:::

After moving to the center, Thordan will cast the first trio of the fight:

#### Strength of the Ward

Thordan will become untargetable and jump from the arena, and both Light parties will split East/West. 

3 Knights will then cleave 3 random cardinals/intercardinals, leaving only 1 safespot either side of the arena. 

The way that the waymarkers are set up means that **Light Party 1** will always be on a **number** waymark, and **Light Party 2** will always be on a **letter** waymark. Two waymarks on opposite sides of the arena will also be the same colour, allowing us to simply call out a single colour to determine both safe spots. 

![](/images/ultimate/dsr-strength.webp)

> In the image above we can see the purple, yellow, and blue waymarks have knights on them. Thus we can simply call out "Red" and both parties will know where they have to go.

Within both of those safespots, each light party will have to spread to avoid overlapping lightning AOEs that are about to drop on each player. These lightning AOEs will go off at the same time as the dashes go off.

While the parties are getting into position **Grinnaux** and **Thordan** appear again, with Grinnaux being placed somewhere near the center of the arena and Thordan in the direct center. After everything resolves Grinnaux will begin to cast a quake that will expand out towards each light party. Avoiding this is simple, just waiting until it is safe to walk forward and doing so. 

While the party is dodging this, Thordan will cast another **Ascalon's Mercy**. Each light party must quickly make their way toward Thordan and stack up tightly on either side of him to bait the proteans.

Thordan will then jump again and land on a random cardinal or intercardinal, as well as 2 other knights dropping onto the arena. For this section of the Trio we will treat **Thordan as our new north**. 

::: info NOTE
Thordan can be tricky to find here if you're spinning your camera around. What you should do instead is look at the 2 knights, who will always be further away from and facing Thordan.
:::

3 players will then get marked with a large blue defamation marker (named Skyward Leap), and large red puddles will begin to grow on the ground. Each of the 2 knights will also tether two random non-tank players (who do not have Skyward Leap) with **Holy Shieldbash/Bladedance**.

Everyone who was not marked with Skyward Leap should quickly find Thordan and make their way to him. The Tanks will take their respective tether (MT left knight facing Thordan, ST right knight facing Thordan) and criss-cross them into the safe spot under Thordan to stretch them further for reduced damage. 

![305584973-9ff95bb1-a663-4834-991b-bef741b5e0cf.webp](/images/ultimate/dsr-strength2.webp)

::: warning
The relative West and East Skyward Leap players should stand on the **edge of the waymark** as seen in the image. If you stand in the middle of your waymark you are likely to kill one of the Tanks next to Thordan.
:::

Just before everything goes off, 6 towers will appear in the middle of the Arena that must be soaked by every player other than the tanks. 

The 3 non Skyward Leap players should line up against the wall below Thordan to indicate which tower they are taking before standing together for a stack that will be shared with both tanks.

::: tank
Each Tank can stand in front of their respective knight to ensure they are the one to grab the tether, before using sprint to comfortably make it to the safe spot.
:::

Each player will then walk forward into their respective tower and soak the damage. If one tower is missed a high amount of damage will hit the party, likely wiping the group.

Thordan will then drop into the center of the arena and cast **Ancient Quaga** and heavy hitting raidwide, followed by **Heavenly Heel** into **Ascalon's Mercy**. **Heel** inflicts a **slashing resistance down** debuff, requiring a tank swap.

He will then begin to the cast the next trio of the fight:

#### Sanctity of the Ward

Thordan will then leave the arena and 2 knights will drop down near the center, on opposite sides to each other. These knights can either be facing clockwise or counter-clockwise, which will determine the way they are about to dash across the arena. A third knight will also spawn on one of the waymarks near the outside of the arena.

The knight at the edge of the arena will then target 2 people for distance-based stacks, indicated by either a single sword or 2 swords above the players head. The player with 2 swords should move _behind_ the third knight, and the single sword player should move to the opposite side of the arena on the same axis as the knight (i.e. if the knight spawns on a blue waymark, the single sword moves to the opposite blue waymark).

Each stack will move 4 notches in the same direction as the knights (CW/CCW). This will leave the party in the 1st of 2 safespots as part of the dashes. After the cleaves go off around them the party will move to 4 notches _before_ the next waymark for the next safe spot.

Just before these stacks and cleaves go off, Thordan and a large red eye that appeared around the arena will perform a gaze attack that must be avoided.

(Diagram for safespots :3)

After the last AoEs resolve, various knights will appear around the arena alongside thordan, preparing to cast various new mechanics in tandem. This set of mechanics is referred to as:

#### Meteors

Players should split off into pairs on each of the cardinals as per the cheatsheet (MT/D3 N, OTD4 S, H1D1 E, H2D2 W), standing between the AOEs that have spawned on the intercardinals. 2 players will be marked by "Meteors", a small red arrow above the players head. These 2 players will **ALWAYS** be part of the same role. The role that gets the meteors is deemed as the "priority" role.

The meteor players will position themselves North and South, swapping with the same respective role player that is already positioned there. _Generally_ the meteor players should try and go to N/S cardinal that is **clockwise** of them, however this rule isn't always followed.

Each pair should stand roughly halfway between the centre of the arena and the edge of the arena to bait a set of partner stacks that will leave a puddle of ice that will inflict a short **"Ice Resistance Up"** buff for a moment, allowing you to quickly move out of the puddle before it applies a heavy frostbite DOT. The large orange AOEs on the intercardinals will also turn into fire puddles when the stacks go off, leaving the middle of the arena unable to access the outer ring and vice versa.

While everyone is moving to their positions, 8 towers will spawn. Some of these towers will be on the outer edges and some in the middle of the arena. If only one tower is available on the outer edge of the arena in a pair's quadrant, the **priority role** (i.e. the one with meteors) should take that tower, and the other player should move into the middle of the arena to soak the tower **clockwise** from where they baited their puddle. If 2 towers are available on the outer edge of the arena the **priority role** will take the left most tower, and the **non-priority role** will take the right most. However this rule is a bit flimsy and most often people will just move to the left/right beforehand to indicate which tower they will take.

The meteor players can be a little different with which towers they want to take. The meteor debuff they both have will cause 8 meteors to drop down on them one at a time. If any of these meteors are close to eachother they will explode and wipe the raid. As such, we want the meteor players to be the furthest distance possible from eachother. 

In an ideal world this means that each meteor player will take a tower that results in them being 180 degrees from eachother. However it doesn't always pan out this way as the tower positions are semi-random, resulting in 2 other patterns where one meteor player will be closer to the other, about 150 or 120 degrees. The 120 degree pattern is colloquially known as **"cursed"**.

To avoid these patterns as much as possible, each meteor player will look at the other and indicate to take a tower to give the largest gap between the two. Once you inevitably get one of these patterns, the player on the "short" side, will have to: Follow the curve of the inner AOEs to use up as much space as possible, and if the pattern is cursed employ stutter stepping to pace out the meteors correctly. This can be difficult at first as the meteors will drop very close to eachother. Fortunately this pattern is pretty unlikely.

After the initial tower soak both meteor players will start moving clockwise around the arena. 8 more towers will spawn on each cardinal and intercardinal and after about 5/6 meteor drops **Faith Unmoving** will be cast. All outside players will use **Anti KB**, and all inside players will ride the knockback into their respective tower. The towers each player will take depends on the initial safespot they started from. **Priority** players will take the cardinal tower, and the **Non-priority players** will take the tower **1 clockwise** of the starting safespot. Both Meteor players will end up in the opposite North or South tower.

After these towers are resolved, Thordan will drop down at true north and begin to cast a heavy hittind raidwide: **Ultimate End**. After this, Thordan gains a "discomposed" debuff, causing him to take 30% more damage. He will then cast **Broad Swing** twice in a row at a random player, where the party will stand behind him and move into the first cleave.

Thordan will then cast his enrage: **Atheric Burst**.

### Phase 3: Nidhogg

::: everyone
This phase begins with a HEAVY raidwide attack and should be mitigated appropriately
:::

Nidhogg will drop down and begin auto-attacking the main tank, before casting:

#### Dive from Grace

::: info NOTE
This mechanic is one of the first "walls" of this fight, and can be difficult to wrap your head around/remember all the roles. I recommend to watch videos of solves and also to review the toolbox above.
:::

As the cast begins, a bunch of numbers will apply to the party:
* "1" x3 (put the symbol here)
* "2" x2 "
* "3" x3 "

Players will preposition in the following locations to indicate their starting position depending on their number.

![314374579-babf8707-75cb-4b42-8c58-70d07df7da93.webp](/images/ultimate/dsr-dfg.webp)

After the cast is finished (~5 seconds later), a second set of debuffs get applied to each player:
* Dark High Jump (Circle)
* Dark Elusive Jump (Down Arrow)
* Dark Spineshatter Dive (Up Arrow)

The numbers players are assigned are the order that each player will be "dived/jumped" on by Nidhogg: 1->2->3
Whilst the second debuff will be what **kind** of dive/jump Nidhogg is performing.

After getting dived the player will leave behind a tower that needs to be soaked by someone else, as both the dive and the tower inflict a **"Fire Resistance Down II"** and a **"Physical Vulnerability Up"** debuff.

The _type_ of dive that Nidhogg performs will indicate **where that tower is going to be placed.** I think of the arrows as if they _push_ the tower in one direction, i.e. If I were to have an Up Arrow, my tower would be pushed the distance of Nidhoggs hitbox away from me in the direction I'm facing. No matter whether players have arrows or no arrows, we always want to place the towers on the **East/West/South** of Nidhogg's hitbox due to another upcoming mechanic.

OCE uses the **"Easthogg Strat"** I.e. we solve the arrows in such a way that all arrow players can simply face east (as long as they are in the correct position) and the mechanic will resolve.

(Diagram for easthogg arrows)

As seen above we place the **Up Arrow** West, and the **Down Arrow** East. If both these players look east the towers will end up on the sides of Nidhogg's hitbox. If a set of numbers **does not** have arrows, they will use the positions they indicated when the numbers first went out.

The order that the numbers will soak the towers is as follows:

(using their previously indicated positions, or their arrow positions)
* 3rd dive players will soak the towers dropped by 1st dive players 
* East and West 1st dive players will soak the towers dropped by 2nd dive players
* 2nd dive players and the South 1st dive player will soak the towers dropped by 3rd dive players

Upon soaking a tower, a Nidhogg clone will drop down and aim a line AOE at that closest player. Simply bait this out of the arena, and **when Nidhogg glows**, step through Nidhogg to avoid being hit.

In addition to all these mechanics, while the first and third set of towers are preparing to be placed, Nidhogg will begin to cast either **Lash and Gnash** (in then out) or **Gnash and Lash** (out then in). On the cast finish, Nidhogg will cast a party stack on one of the players not currently placing or soaking a tower, as well as performing either Lash or Gnash (whichever was first on the castbar), followed by the opposite.

The sets of towers will be dropped when the cast is finished, and the towers will resolve just before the 2nd Lash/Gnash.

::: info NOTE
The snapshot timing for the first attack is on the cast finish, so you're safe to walk through the boss before the animation goes off.
:::

While it is possible to live getting hit by Lash/Gnash, it will knock the player back away from Nidhogg and apply a **damage down** debuff. At the time of writing the P3 damage check isn't incredibly tight, but with only a few damage downs it may be impossible to beat the damage check.

#### Enumeration Towers

Immediately after this mechanic, the tank will take a few more auto-attacks before casting Drachenlance on a random player, which is a short conal AOE that will deal lethal damage to anyone hit.

4 towers will then spawn on each intercardinal around Nidhogg. As seen in the cheatsheet, all players will stack with their partner to begin with. In all but 1 pattern, each Tower will need a different number of people in them, the amount of which can be determined by the number of pillars in the tower. As all the ranged players anchor in their spot, if the melee player sees that only 1 person is required in the tower they start on, they will flex to another tower using the priority **clockwise, then counter-clockwise, and lastly across the arena.** 

These towers will drop clones similar to the ones in dive from grace, however one of the clones will have a tank buster tether. The main Nidhogg in the middle will _also_ have a tether and both tanks will take a tether each and invuln the buster in the center of the arena.

The Main tank will then face Nidhogg south and continue to take auto-attacks. After one more **south-facing** drachenlance, Nidhogg will cast his enrage: **Revenge of the Horde**

### Phase 4: Eyes

::: tank
Tanks should communicate which eye they are taking before this phase, as each eye deals auto-attacks. Generally in OCE, MT takes the **Red** eye, and OT takes the **Blue** eye.
:::

Everyone will begin this phase by grouping on top of Alphinaud as he walks into the arena.

Alphinaud and a random party member will be given a buff that applies to everyone in a short range, hence why we stack up. These buffs: **Soul of Devotion** and **Soul of Friendship** allow players to damage the **Blue** and **Red** eyes respectively. The buffs are also lost upon death.

::: damage
Ranged should begin to focus on the **Red** eye, and melee should focus on the **Blue** eye
:::

Estinien will cast a heavy raidwide and bleed: **Resentment**

#### Hatebound

Tethers will randomly get applied to the party in such a way that there is **4 blue** and **4 red** tethers, attached to their respective eye. Taking damage while having a blue tether will **heal the blue eye**, and taking damage with a red tether will **damage the red eye**. 

At the same time a large yellow orb will appear in front of either eye, and 2 smaller blue orbs will spawn to the sides of each eye.

Tethers are able to be swapped by standing on a player of the opposite colour, so be careful not to accidentally swap by walking on top of other players. In this strat, we want all melees (MT, ST, D1, D2) to begin with red tethers. If a melee does not start with this colour, they will walk to the middle of the arena and stack on Estinien. The ranged player that has the wrong colour will do the same, allowing both players to swap and receive the right coloured tether.

Supports will move to the **Red** eye and DPS to the **Blue** eye as seen below:

(Image)

Once the yellow orb grows **twice**, all melee will walk into it together to take a pair stack. Afterwards, they will split and stand on top of their ranged partner, swapping tethers before moving to the middle. The ranged players will wait for their orb to grow twice, before walking into it. Everyone will then move to the **Blue** eye. All red tethers (now ranged players) will stand in a square-like formation around the eye, and all the melee will stack under the eye.

#### Mirage Dives

Nidhogg will dive 2 random red tether players 4 times in a row. Each hit player must be swapped with to ensure they won't be struck twice and instantly killed as the dive applies a vuln up.

::: damage
Around 38-40% HP on the **Red** eye, ranged should swap to the **Blue** eye.
:::

Finishing all these dives and having good damage will result in both eyes dying before they cast a final **Steep in Rage** cast. If both eyes are alive during this, the party will wipe. If the **Red** eye is alive during this, it will resurrect the **Blue** eye so it's important to keep an eye on it to mitigate possible wipes.

### Intermission

Intermission is a run back of the **Pure of Heart** mechanic from Phase 1 with some key differences.

Most importantly, Haurchefant will now be _targetable_. However he has a "HP Recovery Down" debuff. To remove this, a tank must use **Limit Break 3**, allowing Haurchefant to not only take significantly reduced damage, but also allowing him to be healed.

::: tank
Either tank should LB3 as soon as Haurchefant appears. (This also works roughly after your 2nd GCD on Charibert).
:::

::: healer
Healers should keep an eye on Haurchefant throughout the entire mechanic. You want him to be almost, if not full health before the final **Pure of Heart** raidwide, as it will do significant damage. A WHM can save benediction for this, simplfying the healing greatly.
:::

Following the same H -> M -> R -> T order as phase 1, players will resolve the mechanic and then face an additional DPS check on the **Spear of the Fury** that Haurchefant is currently blocking. Successfully defeating the spear before it casts **Pierce** allows players to continue on to phase 5. If unsuccessful, the party will be sent back to phase 2.

### Phase 5 - Dark King Thordan

After 2 AOE autoattacks, Thordan will begin to cast:

#### Wrath of the Heavens (WOTH/Wrath)

Thordan will become untargetable, and 2 knights and a dragon will drop down on a random cardinal/intercardinal. **This will become our new north.**

A player will then be marked with a blue **defamation** marker and 2 players will be marked with 2 line-AOEs, indicated by orange tethers coming from the knights. 

The tether players will pull these tethers across the arena from their knight, and the defamation will stand near the western knight.

::: info NOTE
Tether players can use the line markings in the arena to line up their tethers. The defamation can similarly count 2 lines from the waymark to the west of the knight to ensure they don't clip the tether player.
:::

The rest of the party should spread along the relative east wall. During this, the dragon will have been casting **Twisting Dive**, and all players should move towards the center of the arena to avoid any twisters that appear under them (or others).

::: info NOTE
For the timing of twisters you can either look at the dragon or the orange tethers stretching through the arena. As soon as the dragon moves (shortly after when the cast finishes), or the tethers disappear is when you should move to avoid twisters.
:::

As Twisting Dive is going off, two more knights and thordan will drop into the center of the arena. After avoiding the twisters, players should spread on their side of the arena for an upcoming protean. A non-tether/defamation player will then be marked with **dive bomb** and should run to the wall behind the **knight with a staff** to bait it.

This effectively splits the party into 2 groups. 4 players who have done a mechanic, and 4 which haven't.

After a protean slash from Thordan a random **non-mechanic** player will be targeted with 5 consecutive **Liquid Heaven** baits, and a random **mechanic** player will be targeted with 4 **Eruption** baits.
2 random players (these can be the same players as above) will also be targeted with lightning AOEs.

(video of baits)

::: warning
It is very important that players stay on their side of the arena here. All **mechanic** players will have a **Magic Vuln** debuff which means that they will **instantly die** upon touching a Liquid Heaven.
:::

Everyone will then make their way to the warrior as he will shortly cast a donut AOE. Everyone should stack near Thordan, whilst the two lightning AOEs should spread near the rear of the donut AOE to form a "Mickey Mouse" style shape.

Both bait players should _not_ overlap their baits on top of the warrior to make room for the rest of the party. It is possible to walk away from the safe spot and loop back around in time to the safe spot.

After this is resolved, Thordan will cast an **Ancient Quaga** raidwide, followed by 2 more AOE auto attacks and another **Heavenly Heel** into **Ascalon's Might** tank buster.

::: tank
Due to the mit plan that MUR PF uses, if the MT is a **WAR** they can use their invincibility here for free.
:::

Thordan will then cast:

#### Death of the Heavens (DOTH/Death)

This mechanic has a lot of moving parts, I highly recommend looking at POVs and toolboxes.

Thordan will go untargetable and jump to the arena's edge, summoning his eye. Several dragons and a knight also drop onto the arena's edge. Another knight wielding an axe will drop into the arena, slightly offset from the centre towards a cardinal/intercardinal. **This knight is our new north.**

The party will immediately line up as follows:
```
        _Knight_
H1 MT D3 D1 D2 D4 ST H2
```
Four random players will be selected with a visible red **Doom** debuff that lasts for 26 seconds, killing the player if it is not cleansed. Any player who has not got a Doom will shortly drop a Doom cleaning puddle. Because of mechanics coming up, we want to spread these at west/east and the northern intercardinals. 

Looking at our line up, each player must determine what number they are counting from left to right. As OCE does **Dooms south**, each Doom player will position themselves 1-4 along the relative south wall. The non-Doom players will do the opposite, lining up 1-4 along the relative north wall. 

Because there will shortly be several dives going through the arena from the dragons and a spread mechanic from the other knight, the actual positions for the intercardinal players can be a little finnicky. Thankfully, the waymarks we use make it incredibly easy:

(image)

Once in position, all the dives from the dragons and the lightning spread from the knight will go off. As one of the dragons was the same one from **Wrath**, there will also be twisters. 

::: info NOTE
The timing for this twister is as soon as the lightning AOE goes off.
:::

In addition, the knight in the middle will also be doing a quake that will gradually spread outwards from his position.

Dodging this is relatively simple. All the north, close west, and close east players will simply hold forward towards the knight as soon as their lightning AOE goes off.
The rest of the players will begin to walk along the arenas edge, dodging in to the 2nd earthshaker AOE that goes off.

As these go off, several knights will replace the axe knight in the middle, including our favourite **Grinnaux.**

Once players reach the middle, everyone will be assigned **Playstation Tethers**. These work slightly different from Phase 1 in that only Doom players can receive circle (which are baited by the furthest away players), and only non-Doom players can receive cross. There can also only be one square and one triangle per group. 

The 1st and 4th Doom will stand outside of the inner circle to bait the circle tethers, and the other Doom players will stand on the relative NW/NE of the middle circle, surrounding Grinnaux. 
The non-Doom players should roughly spread to SW/SE and N/S, using eyes to adjust to be opposite your Doom player.

At this point (if not before), players should be identifying where Thordan and the giant Red eye are as there will shortly be a gaze attack from each of them.

Players will then all look away from the gazes and ride a **Faith Unmoving** knockback from grinnaux. Doom players should immediately move into the cleanse puddles if they aren't knocked back perfectly (I find wiggling in the puddle sometimes helps the game to register you standing in it).

#### Meteors
Without a break, 8 meteors will spawn on each cardinal and intercardinal. The 3 meteors at N/NW/NE will be killed using a targeted magic LB2 on the meteor at north, whilst the rest of the party bursts down the reamining meteors.

Killing the meteors results in Thordan jumping back to the arena and performing another **Ancient Quaga**, followed by yet another 2 AOE auto-attacks into **Heavenly Heel** and an **Ascalon's Might** tank buster.

::: warning
Players **MUST** stop damaging Thordan below %2.8 health. If Thordan dies here it is **impossible** to beat the fight as he will wipe the party at the end of phase 6.
Once this threshold is reached, Thordan will say "I yield..." and drop to one knee.
:::

Players will then immediately position south for the next phase:

### Phase 6: Double Dragons - Nidhogg & Hraesvelgr

An important mechanic to note in this phase is the two possible failure conditions:

**Nidhogg's Vow** - Letting the **Mortal Vow** debuff fall off will result in Nidhogg's Vow being broken (will be explained soon).
**Hraesvelgr's Vow** - Dying to any instance of damage from Hraesvelgr (autos/stacks/AOE/spreads) will result in the Vow breaking.

Breaking a vow will result in that dragon receiving a **Damage Up** and **Damage Taken Down** buff, effectively one shotting your tanks with auto attacks.

Although breaking one of these vows may not be the end of your run later in the phase (i.e. dying in cauterize), early vow breaks will almost certainly result in a wipe.

::: tank
Phase 6 is very tank heavy compared to the previous phases. Knowing your mitigation is key as without the correct mits you may need healer help or you will die.
:::

::: everyone
Throughout this phase there are 2 **hand of pain** style HP checks. Fortunately for us, they're even more strict than Living Liquid. The health differential must be no more than 2.8% between both Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr. Especially during the opening mechanic, DPS must be attacking their assigned dragon and tabbing between both dragons to ensure the health difference is not too far apart.
:::

MT will grab Nidhogg, and OT will grab Hraesvelgr. After a few auto attacks, both dragons will begin to cast:

#### Wyrmsbreath 1 (WB1)

The arena will be transformed into a donut via an AOE.

Nidhogg will then target 3 random **Non Tank players** with fire tethers, and Hraesvelgr will target 3 random **Non Tank players** with ice tethers. These tethers will cause both Pyretic and a Frozen debuff respectively. To resolve this, each fire tether player must stack with an ice tether player to cancel out the debuff. Because we can't determine which players are going to be targeted, we set up 3 groups of 2 people where one person from each will plant while the other will be the designated "flex" player. The flex player will swap with another player if they have the same tether as their partner.

(image WB1)

Tanks however will not need to worry about tethers as instead they will be looking at the mouths of both dragons to determine if they are about to take a single tank buster or a 2 person tank buster.
If **both** mouths are glowing, the tanks will stack and take a buster together in the centre of the arena.
If **one** mouth is glowing, the tank that is tanking the **non-glowing** dragon will take a **large** defamation style tank buster, and the other dragon will do a large conal cleave horizontally through the middle of the arena.

(Image WB1 Tanks)

Immediately afterwards, all players should spread away from DPS players as a random DPS will be assigned **Mortal Vow** in the form of a targeted AOE.

**Mortal Vow** is essentially a 'hot potato' mechanic - at the end of the debuff timer (or when the player dies), it releases a small AoE on the player. Someone else must be hit by this AoE to receive and renew the Mortal Vow debuff. As mentioned initially, letting this debuff fall off without renewal will enrage Nidhogg.

It should be noted that extra people caught in the AoE when passing will receive a vulnerability that will kill them next instance they take damage. Debuff passes will mostly happen in the middle of the arena when it is time to do so. Therefore, unless it is your job to do the debuff pass, stay away from the middle of the arena. Should an extra person catch the vulnerability debuff, they should wall when safe to do so to avoid dying to (particularly Hraesvelgr) a dragon's damage.

::: healer
Mortal Vow gives a mild DoT. It isn't anything you have to focus on heavily but just be aware in case an under-mitted raidwide leaves them on single digit HP.
:::

::: note
D1 and D2 must pay attention to who received the first Mortal Vow as this will affect who does a pass later on in the phase.
:::

After Mortal Vow is given to the first DPS player, the dragons cast:

#### Akh Afah 1

These are 2 light party stacks with a "hand of pain" check - as mentioned previously, if by the end of the cast the 2 bosses are more than 2.8% apart, one will wipe a light party and the pull is essentially done. If the HP's are too far apart, there will be a tether between the 2 dragons which is your indicator to balance them out as soon as possible.

Everyone will be near the middle of the arena for this, with LP1 leaning northwards and LP2 leaning southwards.

Very shortly after, Nidhogg will fly away and Hraesvelgr will cast:

### Hallowed Wings 1 (HW1)

This mechanic involves 2 separately baited tankbusters while only a quarter of the arena is safe. There are 3 components to reading this mechanic and you can read them in any order that works for you:

- Nidhogg will cleave across the entire west or east half the arena. You will have to check the north or south wall to see where he is coming from.
- One of Hraesvelgr's wings will glow brightly, cleaving the entire north or south of the arena.
- Hraesvelgr's head will either be low (tankbusters on the 2 closest players) or high up (tankbusters on the 2 furthest players).

Once you find the safe quadrant, the tanks will position to bait the tankbuster while the rest of the party groups up on the opposite side.

Both Nidhogg will return and both dragons will do a few autoattacks. We will now pass Mortal Vow - the DPS with Mortal Vow and the MT will go mid, passing the debuff to the MT. Everyone else must steer clear.

::: note
Even after Nidhogg returns, it is recommended to focus hitting Hraesvelgr as he will be untargettable for the next mechanic.
:::

After the pass Nidhogg will cast:

#### Wroth Flames

::: warning
This mechanic involves heavy-hitting party stacks while moving, so generally most major mitigations are sent here to ease stress on healers.
:::

4 players will be inflicted with a spread debuff <img width="24" height="32" alt="Spreading_flames_icon1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/164264cb-3da3-45b8-9982-0135aba84d13" />
, 2 players with a pair stack debuff <img width="24" height="32" alt="Entangled_flames_icon1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f81a50-90c2-400c-962b-350cac1e6698" />
 and 2 players with nothing (who will assist with the pair stacks). These do not resolve until the very end of the mechanic.

Nidhogg will prepare Akh Morn (a 4-hit party stack that leaves a lethal puddle behind) and Hraesvelgr will fly away and prepare to cleave the entire west or east side of the arena. Three sets of fire orbs will also spawn that will do large plus + shaped AoEs when they resolve. The goal is to dodge all of these together as a party as you soak the repeated Akh Morn stacks.

The starting safe spot will be close to a corner of the arena. To determine where to start:
- Move to the side where Hraesvelgr isn't cleaving (need to check the north or south wall to see where he is coming from).
- Watch where the 2nd set of orbs spawn and move to the corner opposite it (from north/south perspective).
So, for example, if Hraesvaelgr is cleaving the west side of the arena, and the 2nd orb spawns north east, the party will start south east.

The party will then do a fixed "J" shaped movement, gradually moving to the middle of the arena.

::: warning
stack tightly and do not run ahead - stop at the edge of each puddle before making the next step. Sprint is not essential for the movement and should only be used if you read the safe spot too late and need to make it to the party in time.
:::

!diagram to be added.

After the dodges, Nidhogg will cast Hot Tail (sides of Nidhogg safe) or Hot Wing (centre line through Nidhogg's hitbox safe). At the end of this cast is where the stack/spread debuffs resolve. Note that if it is Hot Tail, the party will resolve debuffs on the side opposite of where they started.

The spreads will spread under Nidhogg, while the stacks move under Hraesvelgr.

::: note
MUR PF uses AMs to determine spread and stack positions. If you wish to do it legitimately, the spreads are fairly yoloable and you can devise a simple prio system (or just communicate in chat) for the stacks. Whatever you do, give priority for tanks to be towards the centre of the arena as they need to move middle for Mortal Vow pass after this mechanic.
:::

After the spread and stacks resolve, there will be another Mortal Vow pass. Both tanks will move to the middle of the arena (friendly reminder for everyone else to not be middle), and it will pass from the MT to the OT.

Use this time to quickly balance out the boss's HP, as after the pass, both dragons will cast:

#### Akh Afah 2

This is the exact same as the first one, position in light parties just like before.

Hraesvelgr will shortly after cast:

#### Hallowed Wings 2 (HW2)

This is the same tankbuster from HW1, but instead of Nidhogg cutting half the arena, he will cast Hot Wings or Hot Tail. Check which half Hraesvelgr is cleaving and his head position. The OT will always be towards the centre line of the arena, and MT, or the party will be under or on the complete opposite side Hraesvelgr, depending on whether it is a near or far bait. Be careful with the Hot Wings pattern in particular as the line of safe spot can be tight:

!diagram to be added.

There will be another Mortal Vow pass after HW2. This will be with the OT passing to D1, unless D1 was the first vow - in that case, D2 will do the pass instead as D1 will have a vulnerability. This is a friendly reminder for everyone else, once again, to stay away from mid. After, both dragons will begin to cast:

#### Wyrmsbreath 2 (WB2)

WB2 as a mechanic conceptually functions the same way as WB1, however this time we don't want to cancel our debuffs out for the mechanic after. Healers and DPS have fixed positions that if done correctly, will always result in them only getting hit by 1 tether and keeping their ice or fire debuff.

::: note
Don't worry if your tether is not stretched, just stand in the exact spot as per diagram.
:::

Tanks once again need to check the mouths of both dragons - if both are glowing (shared tankbuster), they resolve this in the middle of the arena. If only one is glowing, they can move to their fixed spread spot to take the tankbuster (be careful, as you may recall if only one is glowing, the centre is not safe due to the breath AoE).

!diagram to be added. For melees, pay particular attention to the floor patterning to ensure you position correctly.

#### Cauterize

Once everything resolves, the dragons will fly away to north, preparing to cast Cauterize and cleave their half side of the arena with a wild charge (front player takes the most damage) dash. Healers need to quickly top everyone up, paying extra attention if any DPS had an unstretched tether.

The MT will be frontmost on the west side, while the OT will be frontmost on the east side. Both will use their invulnerability here.

Healers and DPS on the other hand need to move to the side with the dragon opposite their debuff. If they were hit by ice in WB2, they will stand in Nidhogg's path. If they were hit by fire, they will stand in Hraesvelgr's path. This is how we will survive cauterize, as well as cancel out our debuffs.

At the end of the debuff timers their effect will take place. Ice players will freeze and fire players will receive pyretic debuff, causing significant damage if they perform any actions.

::: warning
- It is paramount if a healer(s) is fire to quickly top up before the their pyretic debuff activates.
- Fire DPS, ESPECIALLY PHYS RANGED, should untarget the boss so autoattacks do not trigger the pyretic damage.
:::

One extra warning: as the dragons cleave just over half the arena, do not be close to the centre line and make sure you are well into the side you want to be cleaved in.

Once the dragons fly across, everyone will move to the A waymark at north. Healers must quickly top everyone up again. 

::: healer
If one of your tanks is a DRK make sure you individually top them up as well as they have nothing to hit to proc Living Dead.
:::

The dragons jump down for:

#### Touchdown and Enrage

::: note
If one of the bosses had their vow broken due to Cauterize, Touchdown is liveable with a tank LB2.
:::

Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr will slam down on the centre and south of the arena, respectively, for proximity AoE damage. Everyone must run out to finish the bosses off, EXCEPT D3 and the melee who has Mortal Vow, to complete the final pass on the A waymark. They can move along once the pass has completed.

::: note
It is okay for D3 to pass here even if they were the first Mortal Vow player because their vulnerability would have fallen off by then.
:::

Both dragons will then cast Revenge of the Horde, their enrage. Kill them.

::: warning
If the Mortal Vow fails to pass here, Nidhogg will still 'enrage,' giving him a defence up buff. Should this occur and depending on the current HP's of the bosses, you may need to send DPS LB to finish them off.
:::

#### Transition

Once both dragons die,
- If Thordan died in Phase 5, you will wipe here as the Eyes of Nidhogg appear (like in Phase 4), but you will not receive the friendship buff (because haurch lived lmao L bozo).
- If Thordan survived in Phase 5, continue on and prepare for the heavy raidwide transition:

Use this downtime to mark your tanks with Ignore overhead markers, as they will take AoE attacks in the final phase. This will make it easier for the rest of the party to avoid them.

Initially, the eyes will do a small raidwide with a bleed. This does not need mitigations - healers just need to GCD heal through it (do not spend major resources).

Thordan will then return to absorb the eyes. He will do another small raidwide with a bleed to heal through again, same as before.

::: note
For Dancer players: if you are going to use Improvisation for the transition, as soon as Thordan does this raidwide, this is your cue to start channeling.
:::

Thordan will then begin channeling **Alternative End**, an extremely hard-hitting raidwide. Wait till the bleed falls off before applying shields and mitigations, then you will move onto the final phase:

### Phase 7: Dragon King Thordan

#### General Knowledge

::: tank
If not already for whatever reason, make sure both of your stances are on.

The boss does not move for this phase but instead faces the highest enmity target. Mechanics occur based on his orientation so it is important you are always facing him north or south (A and 1, red waymarks for guidance) by the end of every mechanic to help your party.
:::

::: healer
Study your heal and mit plan religiously. This phase is very intense for you, but absolutely doable first-try if you are focused and prepared.
:::

This phase cycles through 3 major mechanics with 2 autoattacks in between. While they are not mechanically complex, they are a mostly a nerves check, hard-hitting
and punishing (almost certain death) if executed incorrectly. There is a detailed mitigation plan available on the cheatsheet, and even more detailed plan based on healer combo in the Mitigations section at the top of this page (this includes mitigations for the transition).

Tank and DPS mitigations, plus H2 30 second mitigation (Sacred Soil / Kerachole) timings are fairly non-negotiable, but there is some flexibility with long healer cooldowns based on the specific healer (e.g. AST may prefer to use Macrocosmos on Gigaflare 2, while WHM may prefer to use Bell on Akh Morn 2). If you're not 100% sure where to use major cooldowns, check a POV or log, or ask for help in #dsr-discussion in MUR.

#### Flames / Ice of Ascalon

During each major cast, Dragon King Thordan will imbue his swords with fire or ice. At the end of the cast:
- Fire: be outside his hitbox.
- Ice: be inside his hitbox (the outermost ring of his hitbox is the border of the donut).

#### Trinity (autoattacks)

In between each mechanic, Dragon King Thordan will do 2× sets, of 3 AoE autoattacks.
- The highest enmity player is hit and receives a stacking Dark Resistance Down debuff.
- The 2nd enmity player is hit and receives a stacking Light Resistance Down debuff.
- The closest player is hit and receives a Physical Vulnerability Up and both a Dark and Light Resistance Down debuff.

:: tank
After every 2 autoattacks, you will need to switch aggro. As you will swap aggro regularly, shirk will not always be up - pay attention to the enmity gauge on your party list and depending the DPS disparity between you and your cotank, you may need to do some switching on/off with your stance.
:::

Each non-tank player will take turns running to the middle under the boss to bait these autoattacks. The assumed order is:
- After Exaflares: D1 -> D2
- After Akh Morns: D3 -> D4
- After Gigaflares: H1 -> H2

::: note
If anyone dies (e.g. D1 dies to Exaflare), someone else can take the auto and switch order with them.
:::

#### Exaflare's Edge

The boss will spawn 3 sets of Exaflares, lethal AoEs that each cascade in 3 different directions as indicated by the arrows. There is one way to dodge them that is guaranteed to work every time, given the boss is facing north/south:

First, move towards the boss's rear. Check whether his swords are ice or fire, and move in or out of his hitbox accordingly. Then, notice how on the Exaflare indicator, there is a beam of light in the center:

<img width="1873" height="1017" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92f31290-52dc-4e64-be27-c366312ffc25" />

Exactly where this beam is, is where you will run to after the first hit. It can be tight on some patterns so hard focus on this spot and run to it immediately as the first hit goes off. After the next hit, you will want to run to the spot behind you, where the fancy lines on the ground intersect:

<img width="974" height="790" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52828b27-66a1-49ac-8c76-af00d3c10223" />

Everyone can just stay here until all the Exaflares have passed, except for the tanks and D1 who will move up opposite of the party for the Trinity autoattacks. These players still need to pay attention to the state of the Exaflares, as they need to position without getting caught by a stray AoE. The main emnity tank should run completely across to face the boss north/south, while the second emnity tank stands on either diagonal on the front side of the boss (i.e. just be away from the party, but not on top of your cotank)

::: note
Sprint isn't mandatory but extremely useful for Exaflares.

If the boss wasn't facing north/south, you can still do the first dodge the same, just use the edge of the intial AoE marker closest to the wall as your indicator to where to run next. Yell at your tanks to do better next time.
:::

#### Akh Morn's Edge

Dragon King Thordan will prepare 3 towers that deal hard-hitting multi-hit raidwide damage. If a tower is unsoaked, it will explode and wipe the party. Relative to his hitbox, 2 red ones spawns top left and top right and a blue one spawns at his rear. The first time the boss casts Akh Morn's Edge, he will do 5 sets of hits, but future Akh Morn's Edges will add 1 extra set.

H1-D1-D3 takes top left, H2-D2-D4 takes top right, and both tanks take the rear one.

Make sure you check whether the boss's swords are ice or fire. If ice, be in the hitbox while in the tower and stay still. If fire, be outside the hitbox while in the tower, but move into the hitbox after the first hit to be in range for heals.

Healers should play safe and spam GCD heals for the duration of the hits.

::: healer
For White Mages, please note Cure 3 will **not** reach the party and you should spam Medica 1 instead (after precasting Medica 2 for the regen). You can use a Lily but do not overspend as you'd want them for Gigaflares (next mechanic).
:::

#### Gigaflare's Edge

Dragon King Thordan will gradually spawn 3 proximity AoEs. Move opposite to where the first one spawned and check whether the sword is ice or fire.

::: warning
If it is ice imbued, you must be as close to the edge of the boss's hitbox as possible. If you are too far in you will risk dying to the proximity damage.
:::

<img width="967" height="686" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c193bdfe-2cc1-4a66-bcea-432f104db655" />

Check where the second one spawns and after the first hit, you want to rotate opposite the 2nd one as a party at max melee distance around the boss's hitbox. As each hit goes off, the party must quickly be topped up as even even with mitigation they are hard-hitting.

After all the Gigaflares have gone off, tanks should continue rotating until the main emnity tank reaches a red waymark to not only reface the boss north/south but to move away from the party for the autoattacks.

#### Timeline

With all the mechanics out of the way, here is the full cycle of mechanics:

::: tank
As a reminder, remember to reface the boss either north or south (whichever is most convenient) during the autoattacks.

**WATCH AGGRO CAREFULLY FOR THE AUTOATTACKS** because if any of you die, it is **very** difficult to recover.
:::

::: healer
Generally speaking, Akh Morn 2 will be the heaviest to heal as based on the mitigation plan, H2 will not have major cooldowns up for this.
:::

- Exaflare 1
- D1 autoattack -> D2 autoattack
- Akh Morn 1 (5 hits)

#### Enrage Sequence

Dragon King Thordan will cast Morn Afah's Edge (no ice or fire here), which will spawn 3 towers in the same formation as the Akh Morn towers. These will kill anyone inside, but if unsoaked will just blow up the whole party. Once soaked, they will continue to repeat in quick succession until the party is wiped.

Relative to the boss hitbox, H1 will stand top left, H2 will stand top right and MT take the rear one. For the next set, D3 top left, D4 top right and OT rear. If the boss is still not dead by the third and final set, it is a wipe.
