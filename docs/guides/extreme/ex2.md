```

## Strategies

### Drum of Vollok

Use pairs from left-right looking at the new platform. Note: For better melee updatime, move you and your partner closer too the boss before the knockback, this should result in the partner landing closer to the boss on the other side.

### Vollok + Aero III

Spread out on the side without a sword in the front two rows. Using only 4 tiles.

### Projection of Turmoil - Bagel (braindead) Strat
AKA: D1CBA4

Party members take positions on the lineup and wait for the line to reach them setting off each explosion evenly spaced out. The tanks follow the line and join each stack to share damage. Once the line passes over a party member they join the group and continue following the line across the room.

`N <-D1 D2 H1 H2 D3 D4-> S`

Tanks both at the start with mits.

D = D1

1 = D2

C = H1

B = H2

A = D3

4 = D4
